# Set up a repository

## Prerequisites
### For MacOS
1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed - for installing Yarn
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) installed - for managing dependencies
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed - for version control
4. [GitHub](https://github.com/) registered - for hosting service. You may use [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) as an alternative. But [GitHub](https://github.com/) offers free [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting static websites and you can show your website to public.
5. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed - a code editor
6. (Optional) [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) - for readable colored terminal

### For Windows
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed - for using Yarn installer
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) installed - for managing dependencies
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed - for version control
4. [GitHub](https://github.com/) registered - for hosting service. You may use [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) as an alternative. But [GitHub](https://github.com/) offers free [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting static websites and you can show your website to public.
5. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed - a code editor
6. (Optional) [cmder](https://cmder.net/) - portable console emulator for Windows

## Getting started
1. Create a folder and open the folder in *Visual Studio Code*.
2. Open terminal in *Visual Studio Code*.
3. Initiate *Git* by `git init`.
4. Initiate *Yarn* by `git yarn`. It will ask you some questions about the project, you may simply press enter to use the default value.
5. Install [*Parcel*](https://en.parceljs.org/getting_started.html) by `yarn global add parcel-bundler`.
6. Add scripts into [`package.json`](./package.json):
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "parcel index.html",
     "build": "parcel build index.html --public-url /dist"
   }
   ```
   - After adding the scripts, you can run `yarn dev` to start the development server (default is http://localhost:1234/).
   - For building pages of production, run `yarn build` and `/dist` is the output directory.
7. Install SCSS plugin by `yarn add -D sass`, it will compile .scss to .css automatically.

## Create your files
1. Create [`index.html`](index.html) at root directory. You may use `html:5` to create a basic HTML5 webpage quickly.
2. Create [`index.js`](index.js) as well. You may use `script:src` to import the js file in [`index.html`](index.html).
3. Create `assets` folder for images, stylesheets, etc.
4. Create `scss` folder inside `assets` folder and a main stylesheet for [`index.html`](index.html), e.g. [`/assets/scss/style.scss`](./assets/scss/style.scss)
5. Import the scss file to [`index.html`](index.html). You may use `link:css` shortcut. Remember to use `.scss` file extension.

## Upload files to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
1. Create [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) for ignoring files generated by package manager.
2. Ignore folders in [`.gitignore`](.gitignore):
   ```
   .cache
   dist
   node_modules
   ```
3. Create a new repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/).
4. Add remote origin by copying the command like `git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git`
5. Check if the origin is added by `git remote -v`. You may see response like:
   ```
   origin https://github.com/user/repo.git(fetch)
   origin https://github.com/user/repo.git(push)
   ```
6. For your first time you using Git, you need to config Git user. If you are not a Git beginner, you may skip this step.
   - Set a Git username by `git config --global user.name "Alyssa Chan"`. Of course you need to replace ~~Alyssa Chan~~ by your name.
   - Confirm that you have set the Git username correctly: `git config --global user.name`. You should see your name.
   - Set a Git email address by `git config --global user.email "email@example.com"`. Replace ~~email@example.com~~ by your email.
   - Confirm that you have set the email address correctly in Git: `git config --global user.email`. You should see your email
7. Add all files to Git: `git add .`
8. Commit change: `git commit -m "your commit message"`. The message should descript what change in this commit, e.g. initial commit, change background color, use larger font size, etc.
9. Push your commit(s) to origin: `git push -u origin master`. You can see your files on your [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository.
